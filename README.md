# License plate recognition

## Description of project
For this project we are asked to develop a car plate recognition system with OpenCV in python. The system should receive a video consisting of 4 types of car plates: Stable plates, moving plates, double plates and foreign plates. The goal is to recognize all the plates and get the output as a CSV file.

### Requirements
- The system should receive a video and output a CSV file containing all plate informations.
- The system should based on OpenCV and not use any open source packages.
- Neural Network is not allowed.

## How to run it

### Requirements
Before running the application the user must make sure that their devices have the following requirements:
- The device must have Anaconda installed.
- The device must have OpenCV installed.
- Highly recommend to use PyCharm.

### Start the Pipeline
1. Open the **main.py**.
2. Change the **path** to the actual path of the test video.
3. Run the method.
4. The final result will be in the file **result.csv** in the root folder.

### Project Introduction
The brief introduction will be in the poster, which can be visited through the path: 'Project-Group-7/FinalPoster.pdf'.

### Work Distribution
The work distribution could be found in the following path: 'Project-Group-7/WorkDistribution.pds'.

### How to Evaluate
The command line program "evaluate.sh" cannot run normally. Our suggestion is that first run the main.py and run the evaluation.py. Please be careful that the path of the groundTruth file should also be changed.

## How to contribute to it
If you want to contribute, you can open an issue relating to a feature, refactor or bug, and it can be worked on. You can clone the repository and work on a branch you created, then open a merge request. We point you to the required template documents (issue/merge request) and the code of conduct located in the docs folder.
